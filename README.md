Maze Solver

Overview

The maze_solver.py script is a Python program that finds a path through a given maze using algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). This project demonstrates fundamental pathfinding techniques commonly used in artificial intelligence and robotics.

Features

Supports different maze formats.

Implements DFS and BFS for pathfinding.

Provides a visual representation of the solved maze.

Customizable start and end points.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd maze-solver

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Usage

Run the script with:

python maze_solver.py

Parameters

You can modify the script to use different maze input files or choose between DFS and BFS algorithms.

Example Maze Input

The script expects a text file format where:

# represents walls

. represents open paths

S is the start position

E is the end position

Example:
#######
#S...E#
#######
